This R package was developed as part of the LiDAR partnership programme between Hawke’s Bay Regional Council and Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research. The sub-project “Quantifying ecosystem services” was a seed / pilot project that aimed to investigate methods for using LiDAR data products in combination with other national- or global- scale datasets to estimate indicators of some ecosystem services.

The authors take no responsibility for the quality and accuracy of the models included in this R package. Ecosystem services modelling is highly uncertain, and the outputs of these models should not be solely relied on for decision-making.

## Installation

You can install the development version of hbrc like so:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
